# first you need to have a remote host(git clone will create a default origin host for you)
# or you can add by yourself
git remote add ucas https://github.com/chenlangping/ucas_algorithm

# get all remote updates
git fetch

# get specific host
git fetch ucas

# get specific branch
git fetch ucas master

# get specific branch and use a specific local branch to trace it
git fetch ucas master:local_branch

# if you change to that local_branch, you can see the new repo
git checkout local_branch

# and origin branch has been fetched to local,but you need to merge them
git merge origin/master

# or use rebase
git rebase origin/master

# you can use git pull to replace git fetch and git merge
git pull remote_host remote_branch:local_branch
