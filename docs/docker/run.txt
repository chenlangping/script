# if you just want to run the container 
docker run -it ubuntu /bin/bash

# -i means to open STDIN
# -t means to open a pseudo terminal

# if you want to run container in the background
# remember !!! it just runs in background, not for "daemon"!
docker run -d ubuntu /bin/bash

# so if you want run some service(long time), you need to some command
# that can run for long time. e.g nginx -g "daemon off;", and -d is necessary
# because you can't let container in the foreground all the time
docker run -p host_machine_ip:host_machine_port:docker_container_port nginx nginx -g "daemon off;"

# run docker container for different name
docker run --name name_you_like
