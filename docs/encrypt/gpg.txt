# install
sudo apt-get install gnupg
sudo yum install gnupg

# key generate
gpg --gen-key

# it will create a directory in ~/.gnupg and all the keys will be stored there
# and it will ask you some configuration, at last it will spend some time to
# generate the random key, you can login with another shell and use following command:
dd if=/dev/vda1 of=/dev/zero

# and after few minutes, the key will be generated
# there will be a hash code, which can replace your email as user id

# now you can see there is a key-pair generated
gpg --list-keys

# output public key and private key(need passphrase)
gpg --armor --output public-key.txt --export user_id
gpg --armor --output private-key.txt --export-secret-keys user_id

# you can import other's public key to gpg, so you can use that key to encrypt some file
gpg --import other_guy's_public-key.txt

# so you can use that public key to encrypt the file.txt to file_encrypted.txt
gpg --recipient user_id --output file_encrypted.txt --encrypt file.txt

# and he can decrypt it 
gpg --output file.txt --decrypt file_encrypted.txt
