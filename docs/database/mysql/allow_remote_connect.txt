# first, you need to let mysql listen on 0.0.0.0 instead of 127.0.0.1
sudo vim /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf

# find bind-address = 127.0.0.1(default line 43) and change it to
bind-address = 0.0.0.0

# restart mysql
sudo systemctl restart mysql

# and now you can access your database like this:
mysql -u user_name -h database_server_ip -p

# but you may get ERROR MSG from mysql, because you don't have privilege.

# at last you need to grant some privileges to someone which can connect 
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'root'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password' WITH GRANT OPTION;
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

# first * means database. and * means all the databases
# second means table. and * means all the tables
# and 'root' here means database user
# '%' means ip address which now means every ip address can access this database
# 'password' here is the password you set for the user
# now you can access remote database, enjoy it ~
