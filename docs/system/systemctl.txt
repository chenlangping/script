# what is the difference between service and systemctl?
when you use service, it actually use the binary file in /etc/init.d/, so you can 
cd to that directory to run those binary files so no need for "service"
But systemctl is totally different, you can write config file under it's directory

# when you install a software, it will add it's service to /usr/lib/systemd/system(CentOS) 
# or /lib/systemd/system(Ubuntu)

# if you cd to the /lib/systemd/system, you'll a lot of .service and .target
# target is a bunch of services
