# start daemon
service start httpd 
systemctl start httpd

# start with boot
systemctl enable httpd

# when you install a software, it will add it's service in /usr/lib/systemd/system
# so systemctl enable will create a soft link to /etc/systemd/system
# and systemd will run all the files that in /etc/systemd/system
